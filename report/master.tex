\begin{abstract}
This report details the design and implementation of a complex number multiplier. The multiplier is capable of multiplying two 8-bit fixed point complex numbers of different bit significances, and displaying a truncated 8-bit result on \glsentryshortpl{led}.

As well as the combinational multiplier, a controlling state machine and binary to decimal decoder have been implemented such that the multiplier can function as an overall system on a \glsentryshort{fpga} development board. A debouncer module is also used to eliminate the effect of switch bounce.

All designed modules have been verified against results calculated using \glsentryshort{matlab} using simulation, and validated in hardware.
